# **Film Finder AI**

Using data from TMDB (The Movie Database) I trained a KNN model to learn movie similarities based on genre, production, ratings, and more. 

The model is deployed through fastAPI with a frontend developed in react. To test the model out for yourself use the link below to access the website 
and type in your favorite movie to get recommendations from the model! If you can't think of a movie, don't worry, Film Finder AI will provide suggestions
on the home page to get your next movie night going!
